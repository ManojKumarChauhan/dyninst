# Personal Fork of Dyninst

This is my personal fork of Dyninst, which includes implementation of my research on binary analysis and instrumentation. I try to update my fork with official Dyninst releases and branches. Currently, it is updated with Dyninst-11.0.0.

Also, I try to upstream my code back to official Dyninst fork.
